description: Study Zapier's App Builder to gain insight on the essential components required to go from API to App.

Platforms do not hard-code integrations with APIs.  Instead they create an open mechanism to build apps that integrate with APIs.

Zapier's mission to connect everything has probably created the most approachable ecosystem to developing "apps" given a services existing API.  What's amazing is they provide a form-based approach to developing an app on their platform.  Through web form wizzards, a developer can go from API to App by registering the API specifics for authentication, authorization, triggers and actions.

* Authentication Methods

  * API Key - App must provide input fields for user.

  * O AUTH 2 - Oauth v2 authentication redirects users to your APIâ€™s site where they can authorize Zapier to access their account which sends a request token to Zapier that is exchanged for an access token.

  * Session Auth

  * Basic Auth

  * Digest Auth

* Triggers - The platform consumes data with triggers by polling or subscribing to webhooks.

  * Polling

  * Subscribe / Unsubscribe 

* Actions - The platform acts on other sytems by registering actions.  Presumably these registered actions can be connected to events in the system.  For example, an employee productivity app may want to registered Clock-In, Clock-Out actions with a system in HR.

* Publish - Apps typically go through a lifecycle on a platform.  They can either be private to a specific account, or public.

  * Build

  * Review

  * Publish
